# Project introduction
You just enter the URL of the product/stock then the website keeps the history of the price fluctuation, presents it to you, and even notifies you when the price drops down that you specified.
It checks the price of the product specified. Not only it checks the price, it extracts the name and information of the product from the website. It gathers information on a regular interval of fifteen minutes and stores inside of the database. If the current price is found to be less than the specified price by the user then, the user will be updated with an email. And the user can also check the history of the price fluctuation through the nice little dashboard.
